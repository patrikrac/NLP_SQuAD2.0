## Dataset
We use the *SQuAD2.0: The Stanford Question Answering Dataset* dataset that can be downloaded [here](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/).


## IPython Notebooks

In the ATML_Project2 notebook we

* investigate the dataset

* finetune a pretrained DistilBERT model (from HuggingFace's transformers library) on the Squadv2 dataset,

* evaluate the model on the test set and save the model and the tokenizer for later use.
 
* create a chatbot that uses the model to answer questions about the dataset.

* implement text to speech and speech to text to make the chatbot more interactive.

* fine tune of the model on the speeech to text task on our voice

* implement an UI to record our voice and then predict the text that is used by the chatbot

* costumize the chatbot to our voice by fine tuning it on our voice

* implement few shot learning by using a generative model.
